# Clock Widget

*Date: 2026-01-17 2235*

## Why
The signage system needs a way to display the current time on the Pixoo64 display. A clock widget provides useful at-a-glance information and demonstrates the system's real-time capabilities.

## How
Created a new Lambda handler following the established news-digest pattern:
- Displays "CLOCK" header in cyan at the top
- Shows current time in HH:MM format (12-hour) centered in the middle
- Shows AM/PM indicator in dim gray at the bottom
- Broadcasts frame to all connected WebSocket clients

## Key Design Decisions
- 12-hour format with AM/PM for familiarity and readability on small display
- Reused the same drawText/broadcastFrame patterns from news-digest for consistency
- Simple layout with three rows: header (row 2), time (row 26), AM/PM (row 50)
- Text centering calculated dynamically to handle varying time widths (e.g., "3:45" vs "12:00")

## What's Next
- Add timezone support via query parameter
- Create a scheduled trigger to update the clock automatically
- Consider larger font option for time display
