# Display Rendering Fixes

*Date: 2026-01-21 2310*

## Why

Two small rendering issues were noticed:
1. The flat trend arrow (→) looked rounded/blurry
2. The "/" character wasn't rendering in the readiness/sleep display

## How

Trend arrow fix:
- The flat arrow's chevron arms were positioned too close to the tip
- This made the arrowhead appear rounded instead of sharp
- Moved arms back 1 column (x-2 instead of x-1) for defined point

Tiny font additions:
- Added "/" character for sleep/readiness format "75/82"
- Added "-" character for potential future use (negative numbers, ranges)

## Key Design Decisions

- Single pixel adjustment makes significant difference at 64x64 resolution
- Font additions kept minimal - only add characters when needed
- Both fixes are backward compatible with existing renderers

## What's Next

- Audit other arrow directions for similar sharpness issues
- Could add more punctuation to tiny font as needed
