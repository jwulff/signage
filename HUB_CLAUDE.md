# ⛔ STOP — YOU ARE IN THE WRONG DIRECTORY

**This is the container directory. You MUST NOT do any work here.**

## Before You Do ANYTHING Else

1. **List worktrees:**
   ```bash
   git -C main worktree list
   ```

2. **Navigate to a worktree:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/Development/signage/<worktree-name>
   ```

3. **Or navigate to main/ for repo operations only:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/Development/signage/main
   ```

**DO NOT proceed with any task until you have left this directory.**

## What Goes Where

| Directory | Purpose | Can Work Here? |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| `signage/` (here) | Container only | ❌ **NEVER** |
| `main/` | Repo operations (create branches, sync) | ⚠️ Repo ops only |
| `feature-*/`, `fix-*/` | Active development | ✅ **YES** |
