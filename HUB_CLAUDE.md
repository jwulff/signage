## DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE

This is a **READ-ONLY pointer**. All project instructions live in `main/CLAUDE.md`.

If you need to update documentation, edit `main/CLAUDE.md` (or the copy in your worktree), not this file.

---

**DO NOT WORK HERE.** This is the container directory, not a working directory.

Read `main/CLAUDE.md` for full instructions, then route to the appropriate worktree:

```bash
git -C main worktree list
```

Then `cd` into `main/` or a worktree before doing any work.
